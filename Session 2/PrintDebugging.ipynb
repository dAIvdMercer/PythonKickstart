        "* **Be Specific with Your Output**: When printing values for debugging, clearly label them. For example, use print(\"Variable x:\", x) instead of just print(x). This makes it easier to know what each output represents, especially when you have multiple print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Print at Key Points**: Place print statements at critical points in your code, such as inside loops, conditionals, before and after function calls, and where variables are modified. This helps in tracking the flow of the program and the state of variables at these key locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Print Variable Types**: Sometimes bugs are due to variables not being the type you expect. Printing the type of a variable (print(type(x))) can help identify these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Use Print to Show Program Flow**: Print statements can be used to show how the flow of control moves through your code. This can be particularly helpful in understanding complex loops and conditionals."
